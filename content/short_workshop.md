title: Short Workshop

This workshop guide is meant to be used when we've only got an hour or two to start learning Python. Keep in mind, you're not going to be able to learn everything in an hour! But hopefully this will get you pointed in the right direction. Now, because the maintainers of Python 2 will stop supporting it in 2020 you probably want to learn Python 3. This all assumes you'll be using Python 3. 

**Part 1 - Setup**

If possible, try to go through [these setup steps](/setup) on your own machine before you come to the workshop. If you get stuck, that's fine! Just come to the workshop with the issue you encountered! 

**Part 2 - Lecture**

The lecture will move through as much of the material for [day one](/day_one_lesson) of the two day Python workshop as we can get through on your own. As we move through the material, please feel free to ask questions if you don't understand something and flag down TAs to get help.

If you feel like you're not understanding something after a part of the lecture - that's totally fine! It's incredibly difficult to pick up all the concepts in such a short time. The next section covers what to do to continue learning.

**Part 3 - Self Study**

Here's a list of potential tutorials and resource you can use to continue learning Python 3:

- The rest of the lesson for [day one](/day_one_lesson) of the two day Python workshop
- The rest of the lesson for [day two](/day_two_lesson) of the two day Python workshop
- Resources on [The Python Guru](http://thepythonguru.com/)
- The [Dive into Python3](http://www.diveintopython3.net/) guide
- The [Pyhton Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/) website (for folks who like puzzles)
