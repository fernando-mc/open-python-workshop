[Interactive Python](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/toc.html)
This includes some theory as well as some practical exercises.

[Python Tutorial from University of Waterloo](http://cscircles.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/dev/)
Follow the tutorial and run interactive code in your browser.

#### Exercises and tutorials in Python 2

These exercises and tutorials are in Python 2, but since they're all browser-based you should be able to follow along regardless of what version of Python you use locally.  Remember the two main differences in Python 2 and 3:

~~~
# Printing in Python 2
print "Hello World"
# Printing in Python 3
print("Hello World")

# Division in Python 2
5/2   # result is 2
5/2.0 # result is 2.5
# Division in Python 3
5/2   # result is 2.5
5//2  # result is 2
~~~
