On February 6 we'll be having the [first meeting](https://www.meetup.com/Redmond-Python-User-Group/) for the Redmond Python user group.

Yay!

**For anyone joining us, here's what we'll be doing!**

<!--more-->

1. We'll start by getting to know one another a little bit. I have a _few_ snacks but we're still looking for sponsorship so I can't provide actual dinner yet, sorry!.
2. When enough people arrive we'll chat briefly as a group and see what people would like to do in the future. Some possibilities might include: lightning talks on cool projects, building projects together, or full length workshops (8-12 hours on Friday/Saturday).
3. I'll make a brief plea to anyone who knows of spaces we can use or a company who might be willing to sponsor us.
4. Then, for the majority of the night, we'll break out into groups of relative skill levels to learn Python! 

Here's what I imagine each group of folks will be doing.

**If you're new to Python or new to programming in general** 

- First, you'll be [getting your machine setup to program with python](/setup)
- If there are enough experienced people to help out then I'll lead you through some [learning resources](/practice/) as a group. 
- If there's time and depending on how the group feels I'm also happy to walk you through Python3 basics myself.

**If you've programmed with Python before**

- You can either get a recap of the basics with the newer folks or jump right in to working on [projects](/projects).
- You might try building your own web applications with python or deploy a smaller project to an infrastructure as a service provider.

**if you're a Python pro**

- Great! I could use your help! 
- I'm hoping you might be willing to help out any newcomers at this first workshop. This means just walking around as people work and being willing to answer questions anyone has.
- Also, please talk to me about helping to organize the group!
