Yay! We are gald to have you join our community of python enthusiasts in Redmond! 

**For anyone joining us, here's what we do!**
 

<!--more-->

1. We start by getting to know one another a little bit. 
2. The general structure of our meetup consists of the following:

	i.   A brief talk or presentation on a python topic by a member/organizer


	ii.  Then, for the majority of the night, we break out into groups of relative skill levels to learn Python! 
	

	iii. The organizers and the TAs help the members along the way. 

The aim is to create a conducive environment for python programming enthusiasts to come share their knowledge, learn and grow. 

**Some important information**

**New Members** 

First lets get your [machine setup to program with python](/setup)

Once you have gotten the tools ready you can go through:

Meetup Founder (and a python ninja) [Fernandos](https://github.com/fernando-mc) excellent self paced learning workshop for python.
The module is divided into 2 parts

After getting your hands a little dirty with python, go ahead and go through our [learning resources](/practice)

**If you've programmed with Python before**

- You can jump right on to the [projects](/projects).
- You might try building your own web applications with python or deploy a smaller project to an infrastructure as a service provider.

**But this is all newbie stuff!**

- Great! We could use your help! 
- We're hoping you might be willing to help out any newcomers at the meetup. This means just walking around as people work and being willing to answer questions anyone has. We have fairly well experienced folks too, so you can work with people on some indepenent projects! 
- Also, please talk to us about helping to organize the group! 

**Contributing to the group** 

- We always welcome snacks, open discussions and an interactive and active participation

- If you have any ideas for space for holding the meetup. Please let us know.
