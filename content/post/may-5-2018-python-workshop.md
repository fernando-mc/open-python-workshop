We’re looking forward to you joining us for A Complete Beginner’s Introduction to Python 3! Here is some information you’ll need in order to participate. It is **very important** that you review this prior to attending as it will describe what you will need to do in order to get setup before the workshop.

### Event details:

- Date: Saturday, May 5, 2018
- Time: 2:00 PM to 8:00 PM

### Before the Workshop

We’re very limited on time for the workshop so in order to get the most out of the workshop please make sure you review this checklist before the workshop:

<!--more-->

- Make sure you can bring a laptop that you have administrator permissions on to the workshop. **An iPad or smartphone will not work**. If you have any questions about your device please let us know!
- Please go through the setup steps for your machine as described on [here](https://www.redmondpython.com/setup/). **If you get stuck** please try to come to the workshop 10-15 minutes early and ask for help finishing up your setup.
- **Pack some snacks (or bring some cash)**! This workshop is entirely volunteer run and because we are offering it for free we have no budget to provide snacks or food. Sorry! If enough people bring money we will have one of the volunteers order us pizza or something else that folks would like for a snack.

**After the Workshop**

This workshop is designed to get you started with as much Python as possible within six hours. With that said, it is impossible to teach you everything you might want to know in such a short period. If you have questions about Python or want to continue learning more after the workshop is over you can always:

- Join the [Redmond Python](https://www.meetup.com/Redmond-Python-User-Group/) Meetup group. There are free meetups every Thursday where you can ask questions and learn more.
- Join the Redmond Python [Slack Group](http://tiny.cc/joinredpy) and ask questions of our members!

Looking forward to seeing you!

Fernando
